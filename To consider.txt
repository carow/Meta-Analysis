Things to consider:

- Heterogeneity in effect sizes is important as well as presenting the results in forest plots.

- Meta-analysis allows us to calculate the magnitude rather than the existence of an effect. Plus, it offers formal methods
to explore and measure heterogeneity.

- If heterogeneity is high, the pressentation of a summary effect might be inadequate. 

- Forest plot should include: summary effect, individual effect sizes and their CI, weighting of each study.


- If we will only use the packages "meta" and "metafor", we could split it up and do for each package the same analysis. What are the differences? 

- When doing the task, the outcome of each analysis has to be diagnosed. Which part is important information for the meta-analysis? And if the important information
is significant, does another analysis have to follow?




Things to ask:
- How detailed should the diagnostic report be? There are so many different packages that can be used for a meta-analysis depending on the data. Shall we write the 
report for every type of data? 

- Is there a dataset they can give us? 

- Turn what into a set of R functions?  





Seven steps of a meta-analysis:

(1) generating an effect size metric based on
continuous data, binary data or correla-
tions

(2) weighting effect sizes by sample size or precision

(3) pooling of effect sizes into a summary, effect or reasoning against pooling (e.g.,due to high variation 
between effect sizes)

(4) calculating confidence intervals for each effect size and the summary effect

(5) quantifying total heterogeneity/variability (i.e., not only between group heterogeneity) in effect sizes 
by an index measure

(6) if heterogeneity is existent: exploring heterogeneity/variability in effect sizes by considering explanatory
variables (e.g., insubgroup analyses or meta-regressions) 

(With the sexpr. expression, when data is inputed and the heterogeneity is high--> heterogeneity is explored with a function, if not high, the analysis stops here??)


(7) presenting results in forest plots or providing respective data (effect sizes, corresponding confidence 
intervals and weights for all included studies) elsewhere (e.g., in a table).
